# Malaria DREAM challenge
## Subchallenge 1
The overall goal of the first Malaria DREAM Challenge is to predict Artemisinin (Art) drug resistance level of a test set of malaria parasites using their in vitro transcription data. The in vitro transcription dataset consists of 55 isolates, with transcription collected at two timepoints (6 and 24 hours post-invasion), in the absence or presence of an Art perturbation, for two biological replicates using a custom microarray at the Ferdig lab. Using these transcription datasets, the goal is to predict 50% inhibitory concentration values (IC50).

Goal: Predict the Artemisinin (Art) IC50 (drug concentration at which 50% of parasites die) of malaria isolates using in vitro transcriptomics data.

Scientific Rationale: Although IC50 measures are not representative of clinical resistance, insights into transcriptional changes that predict IC50 could clarify why we see a lack of IC50 shift in clinically resistant isolates, as well as perhaps a glimpse into the resistance mechanisms if clinical samples were to show an IC50 shift in the future.
